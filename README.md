# Text-to-speechconverter
This is a Text-to-Speech Converter — a small but powerful tool that lets you type anything you want and have your computer read it out loud to you. It’s kind of like having a mini narrator on your screen!  Whether you're practicing pronunciation, want to hear how something sounds, or just feel like listening instead of reading, this tool can help.
